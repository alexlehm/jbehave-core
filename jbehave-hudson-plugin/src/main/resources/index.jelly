  This plugin integrates <a href="http://jbehave.org">JBehave</a> reports with Hudson's JUnit features.
  It requires Hudson xUnit plugin installed.  It supports "free-style", "multi-configuration" and "monitor an external job" projects.
  With "Maven 2/3" projects JBehave results will not appear within the test report if a Surefire or Failsafe report is also generated by Maven.
