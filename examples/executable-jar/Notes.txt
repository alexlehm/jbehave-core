A simple example project showing how to put jbehave, your code and the
stories inside a executable/runnable jar.

The package target creates a jar file containing all classes from
jbehave and its dependencies that can be run with

jar -jar jbehave-executable-jar-example-<VERSION>-jar-with-dependencies.jar,
this way the tests do not have any dependencies except java itself.

Reading the list of story files from the jar file is supported starting
with jbehave 3.7.5.
